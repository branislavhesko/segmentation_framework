# Generic blood vessel segmentation in retinal fundus images

**This repository provides all the tools needed to perform image segmentation, the only think needed should be configuration setting.**

One of the main problems in biomedical image processing is the lack of data. Especially for blood vessel segmentation,
only few public datasets are available. Moreover, this datasets are unhomogenous in size, which may pose problems for a range of approaches. In this repository you may find a simple yet generic approach to vessel segmentation. Images are processed by tiling blocks of a predefined size. There is no prerequisite for image size.
